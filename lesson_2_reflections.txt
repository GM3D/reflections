What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

* An empty repository is created, which contains no commit. It works that way so that it won't automatically include files you actually don't want to keep track of.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

* Staging area is the preparation area for files to be committed. Only files in this area are going to be included in the commit executed next time. It helps to divide changes in the working directory into several commits, each of which consists of a group of changes that represent a logical change to the relevant files.
